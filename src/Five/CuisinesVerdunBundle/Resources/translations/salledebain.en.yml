    text: <h4>Storage/Vanity</h4><p>Cosmetics, hair brushes and curling irons for her, after shave and razors for him, we often find that we lack storage space in our bathroom. For everything to have its place, consider your storage needs before remodelling your bathroom. Beautiful, well thought out vanities will always be essential in this sometimes limited space. Whether you choose wood, European laminate, wood veneer, polyester or acrylic, there is an option for every budget.</p>

    text: <h4>Faucets</h4><p>Faucets are boring? Think again! There is a wide variety of choices when picking out faucets that will best match the bath, sink, or shower you have chosen. Whether you prefer a more modern or classic style of faucet, it is imperative to ensure that the chosen faucet will match your bathroom's plumbing components. For instance, if you have a deep, freestanding bathtub, a freestanding faucet would be appropriate, whereas for a fitted bath, wall-mounted faucets can be a good choice.</p>

    text: <h4>Shower</h4><p>If you are a shower lover, or if you think that your space simply will not fit a tub, you could be pleasantly surprised by the choices we offer. Italian style shower with fitted jets and rain shower head,  or a shower-bath as a compromise, ask us about the choices that are available to you.</p>

    text: <h4>Sink</h4><p>Stainless steel, ceramic, natural stone, glass, waxed concrete, etc... the kitchen sink is a component that should not be neglected. Ask us about the characteristics of each material. For example, glass can be an interesting choice, but watch out for impacts. Once you have chosen a sink, choose faucets that will match its material and style. Think about aesthetics, but also about functionality.</p>
